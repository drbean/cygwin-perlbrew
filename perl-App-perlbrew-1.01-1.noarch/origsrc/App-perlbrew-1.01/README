DESCRIPTION

    perlbrew is a program to automate the building and installation of perl
    in an easy way. It provides multiple isolated perl environments, and a
    mechanism for you to switch between them.

    Everything are installed unter ~/perl5/perlbrew. You then need to
    include a bashrc/cshrc provided by perlbrew to tweak the PATH for you.
    You then can benefit from not having to run sudo commands to install
    cpan modules because those are installed inside your HOME too.

    For the documentation of perlbrew usage see perlbrew command on
    MetaCPAN <https://metacpan.org/>, or by running perlbrew help, or by
    visiting perlbrew's official website <https://perlbrew.pl/>. The
    following documentation features the API of App::perlbrew module, and
    may not be remotely close to what your want to read.

INSTALLATION

    It is the simplest to use the perlbrew installer, just paste this
    statement to your terminal:

        curl -L https://install.perlbrew.pl | bash

    Or this one, if you have fetch (default on FreeBSD):

        fetch -o- https://install.perlbrew.pl | sh

    After that, perlbrew installs itself to ~/perl5/perlbrew/bin, and you
    should follow the instruction on screen to modify your shell rc file to
    put it in your PATH.

    The installed perlbrew command is a standalone executable that can be
    run with system perl. The minimum required version of system perl is
    5.8.0, which should be good enough for most of the OSes these days.

    A fat-packed version of patchperl is also installed to
    ~/perl5/perlbrew/bin, which is required to build old perls.

    The directory ~/perl5/perlbrew will contain all install perl
    executables, libraries, documentations, lib, site_libs. In the
    documentation, that directory is referred as perlbrew root. If you need
    to set it to somewhere else because, say, your HOME has limited quota,
    you can do that by setting PERLBREW_ROOT environment variable before
    running the installer:

        export PERLBREW_ROOT=/opt/perl5
        curl -L https://install.perlbrew.pl | bash

    As a result, different users on the same machine can all share the same
    perlbrew root directory (although only original user that made the
    installation would have the permission to perform perl installations.)

    If you need to install perlbrew using a Perl that isn't either
    /usr/bin/perl or /usr/local/bin/perl, set and export the environment
    variable PERLBREW_SYSTEM_PERL and then install as described above. Note
    that you must not use a perlbrew-managed perl.

    You may also install perlbrew from CPAN:

        cpan App::perlbrew

    In this case, the perlbrew command is installed as /usr/bin/perlbrew or
    /usr/local/bin/perlbrew or others, depending on the location of your
    system perl installation.

    Please make sure not to run this with one of the perls brewed with
    perlbrew. It's the best to turn perlbrew off before you run that, if
    you're upgrading.

        perlbrew off
        cpan App::perlbrew

    You should always use system cpan (like /usr/bin/cpan) to install
    App::perlbrew because it will be installed under a system PATH like
    /usr/bin, which is not affected by perlbrew switch or use command.

    The self-upgrade command will not upgrade the perlbrew installed by
    cpan command, but it is also easy to upgrade perlbrew by running cpan
    App::perlbrew again.

PROJECT DEVELOPMENT

    perlbrew project <https://perlbrew.pl/> uses github
    https://github.com/gugod/App-perlbrew/issues for issue tracking. Issues
    sent to these two systems will eventually be reviewed and handled. To
    participate, you need a github account.

    Please briefly read the short instructions about how to get your work
    released to CPAN:
